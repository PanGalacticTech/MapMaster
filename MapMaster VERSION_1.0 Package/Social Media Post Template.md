Hey, I have been looking for a community to share a personal project I have been working on for my own D&D campaign. Apologies if this isn't suitable content for this group.
 
MapMaster DM's Screen is a simple, Free and Open Source, Virtual Tabletop desktop app, designed for DMing over discord or zoom, or streaming with OBS.
It enables Dungeon Masters to drop battlemap images into the background, add images and icons for player tokens, NPCs and interactable objects, and move them around at will to help simulate and record D&D or RPG style turn based combat.

I made it because I wanted a way of sharing maps over discord, and I wanted a way of obscuring portions of the maps my player's characters wouldn't have seen yet. 
This software has a separate DM's screen map, and a Live Players Map window, so the players only see a clean window with just the map, making this suitable for streaming setups too.

Its totally free, open source and has no advertising. Its still in Alpha testing so I am looking for a few people who might find this interesting to test it out and feed back any issues or criticisms. 

If you think this would be useful for your game, its free to download. This release has a load of icons and a few maps ready to use, but you can add any images you want using the add icon and add image buttons.
A few of the buttons are placeholder text at the moment, so you can get an idea of the features I would like to add in the future if there is any interest. Eventually I hope to expand it to act as an all in one combat management resource.

Most of the map were made myself using https://inkarnate.com/, however some of them were found on google images.
