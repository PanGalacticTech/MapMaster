## Use:
Download zippled .exe file from releases. It is best to keep this bundled with the folders contained in this folder:
-Icons
-logs
-map_backgrounds
-map_icons
-saved_games

MapMaster opens with default map & icons loaded. <br>

### Changing The Background
To change background image, select `Open Background Map` <br>
Then select a new image to insert as the background. I use [Inkcarnate](https://inkarnate.com/maps/) to create my maps, then screenshot and save the files into the
`map_backgrounds` folder. MapMaster will resize the image to fit the window.

### Adding & Deleting Icons & Images
#### Icons
Adding new icons using image files is accomplished by selecting `Add Icon` and selecting any image file. Adding an image as an Icon, will reduce its size down to **25x25px**. For this reason it is best to use icons that remain clear at this small size. I included some examples in the default map, using bright colours and large text. I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create all the icons, then imported them into graphics software to remove the background and export as a transparent PNG. You can also use player character pictures and artwork.
- TODO: Later I want to include a slider to increase or decrease the size of player Icons.

#### Images
Adding images is a similar process to Icons, select `Add Image` and select an image file to insert. Images are NOT resized to fit the window. I wish to add this feature in the future. But for now, either use the python script included in SOURCE `XXXXXX(Coming Soon)` To quickly resize and save images at a suitable size, or resize them using your favourite image editor. I tend to use images to show players artwork, eg of a monster they have just encountered, but then use Icons for combat encounters.

#### Deleting Icons and Images
Deleting an icon or image is done by dragging it towards the top left hand corner of the DM's map, and pressing the delete button. I wish to improve the function of this in later releases.

### The Live Map
The live map is intended as the window the players can view. It lets the DM hide parts of the map, images and tokens they may be arranging out of sight of the players.
If using MapMaster for Discord or Zoom games, or for Streaming Setups, the Live Map should be activated with `Activate Live Map`, and this window can be set as the source for Video Conferencing or Window Capture in streaming setups.

### Map Mask
To set a map mask, click the `Show Mask` button. This will show a grid and the current applied mask on the DM's Screen map. The Current Applied Mask will ALWAYS be visible on the Live Map, letting the DM pre-select a mask, ensuring the players dont get to see a dungeon layout or hidden trap that they shouldnt be able to see yet.
The live map mask will update when the DM's Screen Map Mask is closed using `Hide Mask` 
Use the `Add Mask` and `Subtract Mask` buttons to add or remove mask squares. `Clear Mask` will both clear the entire mask, and update the live map, so use with care. I will change the function of this later to avoid mistakes.

### Blackout
Blackout is set with the `Blackout` button. It applies a black mask to the entire Live Map screen, allowing for scene changes out of sight of the players.

### Range and Scale Functions
_Coming in a later release_

### Icon Window
_Any opened icons should be visible here to avoid opening a new file each time a new icon is required. To be added in a later release_

### Create Token
_Create player Icons and Meeples with basic graphical shapes and text. To be added in a later release._

## Features
### Map Mask
_The mask can be set on the DM's screen, then applied to the Live Map._
